# How to Write This All Up
## Checklists
One idea is to write a bunch of checklists.
The checklists could hyperlink to the more detailed documentation
on each item.
The more detailed documentation describes the "why".

What checklists?

* Nested form/master-detail form
* Many-to-many associations
* Going from HABTM to HMT
* What has what when you're setting up associations
* The algorithms for associations in Rails

## Time
Is this a checklist? Who knows.
Could be, as others have covered a lot of this fairly well,
but not all in one place.
Need to cover everything:

* Choosing date or time
* Writing unit test cases:
  * Choice of time zone
  * How to implement fixtures
  * How to write test case
* Writing code
  * This is covered by other people better than me
  * Wrapping controllers
  * Time intervals versus date intervals
* Getting time from the browser
* When timezones change
* Daylight savings time
  * Not all days have 24 hours
  * The same time happens twice a day (not really because the timezone is different)
